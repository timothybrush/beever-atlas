# Beever Atlas — Demo Workspace

This directory contains everything needed to run a zero-config local demo of Beever Atlas,
pre-seeded with a Wikipedia corpus about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and the history of
the Python programming language.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beever-ai/beever-atlas.git
cd beever-atlas
make demo   # auto-creates .env from .env.example (demo defaults, no API keys to seed)
```

The seed loader starts automatically after all services are healthy, loads the pre-computed
fixtures, and exits. Seeding takes under 30 seconds.

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Disk space** | ~4 GB (Docker images + data store volumes) |
| **RAM** | ~4 GB |
| **First-run image pull** | ~3–5 minutes |
| **Docker + Docker Compose** | [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`** | Required for `/api/ask` (Q&A queries). **Not** needed for seeding. Get a free key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) — no credit card required. |

> **Seeding** (`make demo`) is zero-API-key and completes in <30 seconds.
> **Asking questions** via `/api/ask` requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env` because the QA
> agent uses Google Gemini at query time.

---

## Asking Questions

Once the stack is running and seeded, use `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env`, then:

**Who was Ada Lovelace?**

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/channels/demo-wikipedia/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-key-change-me" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"Who was Ada Lovelace?"}'
```

**What year was Python first released?**

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/channels/demo-wikipedia/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-key-change-me" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What year was Python first released?"}'
```

The endpoint streams [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events):
`thinking` → `tool_call_start` → `tool_call_end` → `response_delta` (answer text) →
`citations` → `done`.

## Browsing the Wiki

Open **http://localhost:3000**, select the `#demo` channel, and go to its **Wiki** tab —
the auto-generated overview, topic pages, FAQ, and resources are pre-built into the
fixtures, so they render immediately with **no API key required** (reading the wiki is
free; only *regenerating* it needs a `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, via the tab's "Generate" button).

## Demo Corpus

The corpus is sourced from Wikipedia under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
Unported licence (CC-BY-SA 3.0). See [Attribution](#attribution) below.

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `corpus/ada-lovelace.md` | Ada Lovelace — biography and early life |
| `corpus/ada-lovelace-contributions.md` | Ada Lovelace — contributions to computing, first algorithm |
| `corpus/charles-babbage.md` | Charles Babbage — Difference Engine and Analytical Engine |
| `corpus/analytical-engine.md` | The Analytical Engine — design, programming, legacy |
| `corpus/python-history.md` | History of the Python programming language |
| `corpus/python-design-philosophy.md` | Python design philosophy and the PEP process |
| `corpus/guido-van-rossum.md` | Guido van Rossum — creator of Python |

The corpus is designed to produce a rich entity graph (Ada Lovelace → collaborated with →
Charles Babbage → built → Analytical Engine; Guido van Rossum → created → Python) and to
demonstrate grounded Q&A with citations.

## Fixture Regeneration

The `demo/fixtures/` files are pre-computed outputs of the full ADK ingestion pipeline run
against the corpus. They contain Weaviate embeddings, Neo4j graph statements, and MongoDB
documents — allowing `make demo` to seed everything without any API calls.

To regenerate fixtures after changing the corpus or models:

```bash
# Requires GOOGLE_API_KEY and JINA_API_KEY in .env
make demo-regenerate-fixtures
```

This runs `demo/seed.py --live --write-fixtures` and overwrites the files in `demo/fixtures/`.
Commit the resulting files to make changes available to other users.

See [`demo/fixtures/README.md`](fixtures/README.md) for the fixture file format specification.
