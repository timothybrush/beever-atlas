"""Integration tests for the planner → compile_folders → apply_folder_plan
round-trip.

The unit tests for each module use synthetic short ids that happen to
match across boundaries (e.g., ``"c1"`` works as both cluster id and
page slug). Real production data uses cluster UUIDs that are NOT page
slugs, so the unit tests can pass while the wired-together pipeline
silently drops every folder. This file exercises the full chain with
realistic data shapes to catch slug/id mismatches at the integration
layer.
