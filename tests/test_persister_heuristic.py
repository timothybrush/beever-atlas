"""Tests for the persister word-overlap heuristic (WS-M9).

The raised threshold must:
  - reject a single shared common word (prevents media mis-attribution)
  - require an author identity match
  - accept 3+ unique overlapping ≥4-char words with matching author
  - accept matching author + 1+ overlapping word with len ≥6
