"""Narrative-article validator — citation discipline + word caps.

Spec: ``openspec/changes/wiki-narrative-articles/specs/wiki-narrative-articles/spec.md``
covers the requirements implemented here:

  - Inline citation discipline (every paragraph cites ≥1 fact_id).
  - Forbidden activity-log narration phrases ("shared a link",
    "noted that", etc.) drop the offending paragraph.
  - Word caps per section (150-400) and per article (1500-3000
    typical, 5000+ landmark).
  - Inference paragraphs (``is_inference: true``) MUST still cite
    ≥1 fact_id; uncited inference paragraphs are dropped.
  - Citation-coverage gate at 80% — articles below that threshold
    return ``rejected: true`` so the orchestrator falls back to the
    module-only rendering.

The validator is FAIL-SAFE: any unexpected exception falls back to
``([], {rejected: True, reason: "validator_exception"})`` rather than
raising. The orchestrator persists ``narrative_sections=[]`` in that
case and the page renders module-only.

Public surface: ``validate_narrative_sections(sections, facts)`` →
``(cleaned_sections, telemetry)``. Pure function — no IO, no LLM.
