"""Prompt templates for each wiki page type.

Design philosophy: STRUCTURE FIRST — diagrams, tables, bullet points, then supporting text.
Domain-agnostic — works for tech, community, research, personal, and enterprise channels.

Phase 4 (wiki_compiler_v2): the Key Facts table becomes a deterministic,
compiler-rendered block. The v2 prompts emit the literal marker
`<<KEY_FACTS_TABLE>>` on its own line; the compiler splices the rendered
table after `_postprocess_content`. The legacy (pre-v2) prompts are kept
intact below so `wiki_compiler_v2=OFF` behavior stays byte-identical.

)

OVERVIEW_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge wiki compiler. Create an **Overview** page for this channel.

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary"}}

## Content structure (follow this order strictly — INTRO FIRST, then visuals)
1. **Brief intro** — 2-3 sentences describing what this channel is about, its purpose, and the key knowledge areas it covers. THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST CONTENT. Set the context for the reader before showing any visuals.
2. **Concept map** — ```mermaid flowchart showing how the main themes relate. Use the topic relationships data to build accurate connections. Prefer a small number of high-signal edges (≤ 12) over an exhaustive web — the goal is a glanceable overview, not a citation graph.
3. **Key Highlights table** — GFM table summarizing: total topics, decisions made, key contributors, resources shared, active period. **CRITICAL**: use the EXACT numbers from the channel-data block below — `{decisions_count}` for "Decisions Made", `{people_count}` for "Key Contributors", `{media_count}` for "Resources Shared". Do NOT recompute these from topic descriptions; the provided counts are authoritative.
4. **Key contributors** — bullet list of most active people and their roles/expertise. When folder structure exists, GROUP contributors by the folder/area they're most active in (e.g. `**Security & Code Quality** — Jacky Chan, Alan Yang`). Otherwise list flat.
5. **Tools & resources** — if technologies or tools data exists, show as bullet list or GFM table. Skip this section entirely if no tools/technologies are relevant.

DROPPED SECTIONS (do NOT emit):
- "Topics at a glance" — the renderer shows folder cards + topic cards directly with previews; a duplicate bullet list is noise.
- "Recent momentum" — the renderer shows freshness chips in the header; a vague prose summary adds no signal.

## Writing style
- **Synthesize, don't narrate.** Transform raw facts into insights. Write "The team identified context graphs as a key architecture pattern for agent safety [1]" — NOT "Jacky Chan shared a link about context graphs [1]".
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "shared an article", "posted about", "mentioned that", "noted that", "presented a". These produce activity-log narration, not knowledge.
- Avoid filler phrases that add no information: "crucial for", "under discussion", "actively testing", "plays a key role in", "is a subject of ongoing", "highlights the importance of". Replace with concrete verbs naming the specific outcome or blocker.
- Lead with the INSIGHT or CONCLUSION, then cite the source. The reader wants to know what matters, not who posted what.
- Use active voice describing the knowledge itself: "Context graphs prevent agents from using expired data [3]" — not "It was shared that context graphs prevent..."
- When multiple people contributed to a theme, synthesize their collective input rather than listing each person's individual share.

## Adaptive instructions
- Adapt your language to match the channel's domain. If the data is technical, use technical terms. If it's a community or personal channel, use appropriate casual language.
- The concept map should reflect the actual relationships in the data — don't force a technical "architecture" if the channel discusses non-technical topics.
- Only include sections where data exists. If there are no technologies, skip "Tools & resources". If there are no decisions, don't mention them prominently.

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each numbered section above MUST be a ## heading (e.g. `## Concept Map`, `## Key Highlights`). Use ### for sub-sections within them. This creates a navigable table of contents.
- Use ```mermaid for diagrams. Keep syntax SIMPLE — use ONLY `graph TD` with `ID[Label] --> ID[Label]` edges. Every node MUST use a short ID with a descriptive label: `DS[Data Sources]` not just `Data Sources`. FORBIDDEN: subgraph, end, style, classDef, parentheses inside brackets, quotes inside labels, `-- text -->` dash-space style labels, semicolons, chained arrows like `A --> B --> C` (use separate lines: `A --> B` then `B --> C`). USE `-->|label|` pipe-style to label edges (e.g., `A -->|uses| B`). Example: `graph TD\n    DS[Data Sources] -->|feeds| PR[Processing]\n    PR -->|outputs| ST[Storage]`. **Every ```mermaid block MUST end with a line containing only ``` (three backticks) — never leave a mermaid block unclosed.**
- Use ```chart for data charts with exact JSON: {{"type":"donut","title":"...","data":[{{"name":"X","value":N}}],"xKey":"name","series":["value"]}}
- Use GFM tables for structured data. ALWAYS include the header separator row. Example:\n  | Column A | Column B |\n  |----------|----------|\n  | value 1  | value 2  |
- Use bullet points over paragraphs when listing facts
- Add [N] citation markers on factual claims. **Maximum 3 citations per sentence** — never list long chains. (use actual numbers: [1], [2], [3]). **Maximum 3 citation markers per sentence.** If a claim has many sources, pick the 2-3 most relevant — do NOT list long chains like [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] or [1][2][5][6][8][9][10]. Long citation chains clutter the text and are unreadable. **CRITICAL: Key contributors bullets may have at most 3 [N] markers total — pick the most representative citations and stop.**
- Do NOT use @, #, or $ prefixes for entity names — just write names normally
- If media (images/PDFs/links) exist, embed important ones with a brief description line BEFORE each embed explaining what it shows: `**Dashboard Overview** — Key metrics for the project.` then `![Dashboard](url)` on the next line. Do NOT use bare bullet points with just a link.
- Use ONLY inline [N] markers for citations. Do NOT generate any source list, reference section, citation block, or numbered bibliography — the UI renders citations separately. FORBIDDEN at end of content: `## Sources`, `### Sources`, `- [1] @Author...`, `[1]: Author...`.
- Keep output concise and readable: avoid repeated sections, avoid repeating the same link/title in multiple sections, and keep each bullet to one idea.
- Preserve canonical naming from provided data (do not invent alternate spellings like different bot/product names).
- **Maximum 15 edges** in the concept map mermaid diagram. Show only the strongest topic relationships — do NOT connect every topic to every other topic.
- **Maximum 10 tools** in the Tools & Resources section. Only list tools mentioned by 2+ people or in 3+ facts. Exclude generic tools like messaging apps (Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage), operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows), and text editors (VS Code).

TOPIC_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge wiki compiler. Create a **Topic** page for the cluster below.

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary"}}

## Content structure (follow this order strictly — TL;DR FIRST, then DIAGRAM, then text)
1. **TL;DR** — A single bold sentence summarizing the key insight of this topic. THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST LINE. Example: `**Multi-agent systems fail primarily due to inadequate memory engineering, not limited context windows.**`
2. **Concept diagram** — ```mermaid diagram showing how the key entities (people, decisions, concepts) relate within this topic. Use the entity relationships data to build accurate connections.
3. **Key Facts** — GFM table with columns: Fact, Source, Type, Importance — showing the most important facts with [N] citations
4. **Overview** — 2-3 sentences summarizing this topic: what it covers, why it matters, and its current state (AFTER the diagram and table)
5. **Decisions & outcomes** — if decisions exist, show as GFM table with columns: Decision, Status, Made By, Date. Use status badges: ✅ active, ❌ superseded, ⏳ pending. Skip if no decisions.
6. **Contributors** — bullet list of people involved with their roles (decision maker, contributor, expert, mentioned)
7. **Tools & resources** — if technologies/tools exist, bullet list. Skip if none.
8. **Current state & open questions** — what's resolved vs. still open. Use bullet points. Each open question MUST include when it was first raised (e.g., "(raised Jan 2026)") so readers can assess staleness.
9. **Media & Resources** — if media exists, each item MUST have a brief description line explaining what it shows/contains BEFORE the embed/link. **For IMAGES** (URLs ending in .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.webp/.svg, OR URLs from `files.mattermost.com` / `files.slack.com` / image-hosting domains), use IMAGE syntax `![Alt text](url)` — NOT link syntax `[Title](url)` — so the wiki renders an inline preview. **For PDFs and links**, use link syntax `[Title](url)`. **For VIDEOS** (URLs from youtube.com / vimeo.com or ending in .mp4/.webm), use link syntax `[Video title](url)` and the renderer will detect + embed. Do NOT use bare bullet points with just a link. Skip if none.
10. **See Also** — if related topics exist (use the `related_topics` data block — each entry has `title` and `id`), list them as MARKDOWN LINKS so the UI can route to the destination. **MAX 5 entries.** Each line: `- **[Title](/wiki/<slug>)** — one-line reason this topic is related (shared people, shared entities, downstream dependency, etc.)`. The `<slug>` is the part of the related topic's id AFTER the `topic-` prefix (e.g., id `topic-auth-migration` → `[Title](/wiki/auth-migration)`). Pick the 5 most strongly related — DO NOT dump every other topic in the wiki. Skip the section entirely when no truly related topics exist (a wall of weakly-related links is worse than no links).

## Writing style
- **Synthesize, don't narrate.** Write "The team adopted a wiki-first architecture for 10x cost reduction [1]" — NOT "Thomas Chong shared that the wiki-first architecture offers cost reduction [1]".
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "shared an article", "posted about", "mentioned that", "noted that", "presented a", "highlighted that". These produce activity-log narration.
- AVOID filler phrases: "crucial for", "under discussion", "actively testing", "plays a key role in", "is a subject of ongoing", "highlights the importance of", "paves the way for", "underscores the need". Replace with concrete verbs naming the specific outcome, blocker, or unresolved question.
- Lead with the INSIGHT, then cite. The reader wants knowledge, not a timeline of who said what.
- In the Key Facts table, state the fact itself — not "Person X observed that [fact]". Write the fact directly.
- When listing open questions, include when the question was raised (e.g., "(raised Jan 2026)") so readers can assess staleness.

## Adaptive instructions
- The concept diagram should reflect actual entities and relationships from this topic — not a generic template
- If this topic is about a technical system, show system relationships. If about a community event, show event logistics. If about research, show methodology flow. Adapt to the content.
- Prioritize showing high-quality, high-importance facts in the Key Facts table
- Every factual claim MUST have a [N] citation marker

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each numbered section above MUST be a ## heading (e.g. `## Concept Diagram`, `## Key Facts`). Use ### for sub-sections. This creates a navigable table of contents.
- ALWAYS include at least one ```mermaid diagram. Keep syntax SIMPLE — use ONLY `graph TD` with `ID[Label] --> ID[Label]` edges. Every node MUST use a short ID with a descriptive label: `AG[AI Agent]` not just `AI Agent`. FORBIDDEN: subgraph, end, style, classDef, parentheses inside brackets, quotes inside labels, `-- text -->` dash-space style labels, semicolons, chained arrows like `A --> B --> C` (use separate lines). USE `-->|label|` pipe-style to label edges with relationship type (e.g., `A -->|uses| B`, `A -->|decided| B`, `A -->|depends on| B`).
- Use ```chart for quantitative data with JSON: {{"type":"bar","title":"...","data":[...],"xKey":"name","series":["value"]}}
- Prefer tables and bullet points over long paragraphs
- Add [N] citation markers (actual numbers) on every factual claim. **Maximum 3 citations per sentence** — pick the most relevant, never list long chains like [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Do NOT use @, #, or $ prefixes — write entity names normally
- If media exists, embed: ![desc](url) for images, [name](url) for docs/links
- Use ONLY inline [N] markers for citations. Do NOT generate any source list, reference section, citation block, or numbered bibliography — the UI renders citations separately. FORBIDDEN at end of content: `## Sources`, `### Sources`, `- [1] @Author...`, `[1]: Author...`.
- Keep the page focused: maximum 8 rows in Key Facts; avoid duplicate facts across Key Facts and Details.
- Preserve canonical naming from provided data; do not alternate spellings for the same entity.
- **Maximum 12 edges** in the concept diagram. Focus on the most important entity relationships.
- **Thin-data rule**: If `fact_count` ≤ 8, use CONDENSED format instead of the full structure above: (1) TL;DR bold sentence, (2) Key Facts table (max 5 rows), (3) Summary paragraph. SKIP concept diagram, Decisions table, Open Questions, See Also, and Contributors.

4. **Contributors table** — GFM table with columns: Name, Role/Expertise, Topics Active In, Key Contributions, Decisions Made
5. **Collaboration patterns** — bullet points on notable collaboration patterns, expertise clusters, and knowledge areas

## Writing style
- Describe what each person DOES and KNOWS — not what they "shared" or "posted". Write "Thomas Chong drives architecture decisions for Beever Atlas [1]" — NOT "Thomas Chong shared several messages about architecture [1]".
- In the Contributors table, "Key Contributions" should describe impact (e.g., "Designed the memory hierarchy and led database selection") — not activity (e.g., "Shared 14 messages across 8 topics").
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "posted about", "mentioned that". AVOID filler: "crucial for", "under discussion", "actively testing", "plays a key role in".

## Adaptive instructions
- Use "Contributors" and "Experts" language rather than "Team members" — this works for open communities, research groups, and enterprise teams alike
- The mermaid diagram should show actual relationships from the edge data: who DECIDED what, who WORKS_ON what, who USES which tools
- If the channel has few people (1-3), keep the diagram simple. For larger groups (5+), focus on the most active contributors.

## Rules

     A: [answer text] [N]

   - After the last Q&A in a topic group, add a `---` horizontal rule to visually separate it from the next section.
4. **Related pages** — bullet list suggesting which wiki pages have more detail on each topic

Good: "MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) standardizes how AI agents call Beever Atlas capabilities through a unified interface. It separates tool invocation (MCP) from guidance/instructions (Skills), enabling agents to interact with the system without custom integrations [1]."
- Answers should help someone UNDERSTAND the topic, not just confirm it exists.
- **Verbatim reuse**: if a candidate question already has an `answer` field containing 2+ sentences with citation markers, reuse that answer **verbatim** (preserve its wording and `[N]` citations). Only rewrite when the candidate answer is <2 sentences, lacks citations, or is clearly malformed.
- Each Q&A pair must be visually separated with a blank line before and after the answer — never run Q&A pairs together in a single paragraph.
- FORBIDDEN: 1-sentence answers that merely restate who said what.

## Adaptive instructions
- These Q&A pairs were extracted from actual channel discussions — they represent real questions people asked and answers that emerged
- Include ALL provided FAQ candidates. Only deduplicate if two questions from different topics are nearly identical (>90% overlap in meaning) — in that case merge and cite both sources.
- If no FAQ candidates exist at all, produce: "No frequently asked questions have emerged from channel discussions yet. As more conversations happen, common questions and their answers will appear here."
- Order questions within each topic by relevance/importance, not chronologically

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)

GLOSSARY_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge wiki compiler. Create a **Glossary** page.

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary"}}

## Content structure (follow this order strictly)
1. **Relationship diagram** — if 5+ terms exist, include a ```mermaid diagram showing how terms relate to each other (which terms are used together, which are sub-concepts of others). THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST CONTENT ELEMENT (skip if fewer than 5 terms — start with Introduction instead).
2. **Introduction** — 1 sentence: "Key terms, acronyms, and concepts used in this channel."
3. **Terms table** — GFM table with columns: Term, Definition, First Mentioned By, Related Topics. Sort alphabetically. In the "First Mentioned By" column, write "—" when the source is unknown; NEVER write placeholder markers like `(Implicit)`, `(Inferred)`, `(Unknown)`, `(N/A)`, or any parenthesized guess.
4. **Category breakdown** — if terms naturally group into categories (e.g., technical terms, process terms, domain terms), add a brief categorized list after the table

## Writing style
- Define each term in the context of THIS CHANNEL, not as a generic dictionary entry. Bad: "Neo4j is a graph database management system." Good: "Neo4j is used as the primary knowledge graph store for Beever Atlas, storing entity relationships extracted from channel conversations."
- Every definition should answer: "What is this AND how does this channel use it?"
- FORBIDDEN: Generic definitions that could come from Wikipedia. Always tie back to channel context.

## Adaptive instructions
- Glossary terms can be anything channel-specific: technical jargon, project codenames, acronyms, community slang, research terminology, business terms
- Enrich definitions where the provided data is thin — add context about how the term is used in this channel specifically
- If no glossary terms exist, produce: "No channel-specific terms have been identified yet. As more specialized vocabulary emerges in discussions, it will be cataloged here."
- Cross-reference related topics where possible

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each numbered section above MUST be a ## heading (e.g. `## Terms`, `## Relationship Diagram`). Use ### for sub-sections or categories. This creates a navigable table of contents.
- Use GFM tables for the main term list — this is the primary content
- Use ```mermaid for the relationship diagram. Keep syntax SIMPLE — use ONLY `graph TD` with `ID[Label] --> ID[Label]` edges. Every node MUST use a short ID with a descriptive label. FORBIDDEN: subgraph, end, style, classDef, parentheses inside brackets, quotes inside labels, `-- text -->` dash-space style labels, semicolons, chained arrows like `A --> B --> C` (use separate lines).

2. **Resources table** — GFM table with columns: Name, Type, Shared By, Context, Link — show only the most useful items (max 40 rows), prioritized by relevance and diversity of sources
3. **Overview** — 1-2 sentences summarizing what resources have been shared in this channel (AFTER chart and table)
4. **Images** — if images exist, show only top 10. Each image MUST have a brief description line BEFORE the embed explaining what the image shows and why it's useful, then the embed on a new line. Format:\n   `**Beever Atlas Insights Dashboard** — Shows key metrics including total memories, queries, and cost savings for the project.`\n   `![Beever Atlas Insights Dashboard](url)`\n   Skip if none.

7. **Videos** — if videos exist, show with brief description and link. Skip if none.

## Writing style
- In the Context column and section descriptions, explain WHY a resource matters — not just that it was shared. Write "Architecture reference for the 3-tier memory hierarchy design" — NOT "Thomas Chong shared this image."
- Group related resources thematically (e.g., "Memory System Research", "Project Mockups") rather than just by media type.
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "shared an article", "posted about".

## Adaptive instructions
- Group resources by type for easy scanning
- Include the context in which each resource was shared — what was the discussion about when this was posted?
- For images, always embed with ![desc](url) so they render inline
- For documents and links, use [name](url) format
- If a resource was referenced by multiple people or in multiple contexts, note that

STRUCTURE_PLANNER_PROMPT = """You are an information architect organizing a knowledge wiki for a chat channel.

The wiki has many topic pages. Your job is to decide how to **group them into folders** so the operator can navigate efficiently. A folder is a first-class wiki page with its own synthesized index AND a list of child pages (sub-folders or leaf topics).

## Inputs

### Channel narrative
{channel_summary}

### Topic clusters (you MUST place each exactly once in your output)
{cluster_index_json}

### Heuristic candidate groups (deterministic clusters discovered from prefix similarity, entity overlap, and co-citation density)
{candidates_json}

## Your task

Produce a JSON object with this exact shape:

{{
  "folders": [
    {{
      "slug": "kebab-case-folder-id",
      "title": "Human Folder Name",
      "child_slugs": ["cluster-id-1", "cluster-id-2"],
      "rationale": "1-line explanation of why these belong together"
    }}
  ],
  "leaves": ["cluster-id-3", "cluster-id-4"]
}}

## Hard rules

1. **Every cluster id from the input list MUST appear exactly once** — either inside one folder's `child_slugs`, OR in `leaves`. Never both. Never neither.
2. **Folder slugs MUST be kebab-case ASCII** (e.g., `beever-atlas`, `security`, `growth-marketing`). NO spaces, NO uppercase, NO underscores.
3. **Folder slugs MUST NOT collide with any cluster id.** Check before naming.
4. **Maximum depth = 4.** A folder may contain other folders, but the deepest nested folder may have leaves at most 4 levels from the root.
5. **Default to depth 2.** Only nest a folder inside another folder when the inner group is genuinely a sub-domain (e.g., "GitHub" inside "Beever Atlas").
6. **Use the candidate groups as a strong prior.** Confirm them, rename them, expand them, or split them — but don't invent radically different groupings unless the candidates clearly miss a pattern.
7. **Output JSON ONLY.** No markdown code fences. No leading or trailing prose. Just the JSON object.

## Quality bar — be assertive about grouping

- **AIM TO PUT EVERY TOPIC IN A FOLDER.** A topic should only land in `leaves` (root-level) when it truly fits no group — not when it's merely the only one in a small bucket.
- A folder of **2** topics is fine. A folder of 1 is not (singletons stay loose).
- Loose, broad categories are valid and encouraged: `admin`, `tooling`, `external-partnerships`, `events`, `engineering-misc`, `meeting-notes`, `legal-and-licensing`, `funding-and-grants`. Don't be afraid to invent these — operators prefer "everything has a home" over "20 unassigned topics at root."
- Folder titles read like Notion section names: short, scannable, normally capitalized ("Security", "Growth Campaigns", "Admin").
- Prefer **2-level depth** (root folder containing topics) for the bulk of the tree. Nest a 3rd level (folder → folder → topic) only when an inner sub-domain is clearly distinct.
- A wiki with **5-8 folders covering 80%+ of topics** is the target. A wiki with 3 folders + 12 unassigned root topics is too sparse — be more assertive.

## Module-selection rules

- **HARD RULE — Module #1 in your plan MUST be `hero_summary` unless `fact_count` is 0.** The hero_summary frontend module reads your `tldr` and `overview` to render the page header (bold TL;DR + summary + stat strip). Skipping it leaves the page without a header.
- **HARD RULE — When `archetype == "decision"`, module #2 in your plan MUST be `decision_banner`.** The page is centered on the decision; the banner spotlights it (decision text, decided_by, decided_at) above all other content. Skipping `decision_banner` on Decision-archetype pages buries the headline in a key_facts row.
- **HARD RULE — When `tension_count` ≥ 1, include `tension_callout` in your plan IMMEDIATELY after `hero_summary` (or after `decision_banner` on Decision-archetype pages).** The tension callout surfaces a contradicting position pair (one author recommends X, another flags X as concerning) — it is high-signal content the reader must see near the top, not buried below `key_facts`. On a Topic-archetype page the order is `hero_summary` → `tension_callout` → ... ; on a Decision-archetype page it is `hero_summary` → `decision_banner` → `tension_callout` → ... .
- **HARD RULE — When `numeric_fact_count` ≥ 3, place `stat_strip` IMMEDIATELY after `hero_summary` (module #2).** The numeric values ARE the headline for metric-heavy topics; surfacing them as cards before the prose lets the reader grasp the magnitude in one glance. (When BOTH `decision_banner` and `stat_strip` qualify, `decision_banner` wins module #2 and `stat_strip` becomes module #3 — decisions outrank metrics. When `tension_callout` is also present, place it before `stat_strip` — tensions outrank metrics.)
- **HARD RULE — The LAST module in your plan MUST be `provenance_drawer` whenever `fact_count` ≥ 1.** It exposes the source messages each fact came from with platform deep-links — both human readers and LLM agents reading the wiki rely on this drill-down. Place it AFTER `related_threads` (or at the very end when `related_threads` is absent).
- **HARD RULE — When `glossary_terms_used` ≥ 2, include `acronym_legend` near the END of the page (just before `provenance_drawer` when both are present).** Readers reach the legend after working through the prose; placing it at the top wastes header real estate.
- **HARD RULE — When `child_count` ≥ 1, include `subpage_cards` in your plan.** Place it AFTER the spine modules (`key_facts`, `decision_log`) and BEFORE `related_threads`. The page is a parent overview for sub-topic pages; readers need a card grid to navigate to them. (The validator suppresses singleton parents — `child_count == 1` is dropped post-plan as "use an inline link instead".)
- Pick **3 to 7 modules** total (excluding `hero_summary` and `provenance_drawer`, which are always present when their rules fire). Below 3 content modules the page reads as a stub; above 7 it reads as a kitchen sink.
- A module is ELIGIBLE only when its selection rule (in the catalog above) is satisfied. Do NOT pick a module whose rule is not met — the validator will drop it.
- Order modules by reading priority: hero_summary first, then stat_strip (when present), then facts/decisions, then supporting visuals, then related_threads, then acronym_legend, then provenance_drawer LAST.
- Anchors are lowercase + alphanumeric + dashes, ≤ 24 chars (e.g., `decision-log`, `related-threads`).
- For media: pick AT MOST ONE `media_hero` per page. Pin `media_inline` items to a fact_id. Pool unpinned media into `media_gallery`.

## Body authoring rules

- The body MUST contain one ``<<MODULE:<id>>>`` marker per module in your plan, in plan order. The compiler substitutes each marker with the module's deterministic content.
- Optionally include a 1-2 sentence connector paragraph BEFORE each marker (e.g. "Three decisions shaped the rollout schedule:" before `<<MODULE:decision_log>>`). Connectors are optional — skip when the module's heading is self-explanatory.
- For `media_inline:<media_id>` markers, place each marker IMMEDIATELY after the paragraph discussing the source fact for that media. The reader sees the visual alongside the prose that introduces it.
- Do NOT re-emit structured data the modules render (no decision tables, no fact tables, no quote blockquotes, no entity graphs in the body — emit the marker instead).
- Do NOT write a "Sources" or "References" section. The CitationPanel renders those.
- Do NOT use @ / # / $ entity prefixes — write names normally.

## Hard rules

- Output JSON ONLY. No markdown fences around the outer JSON. No prose before or after the outer object.
- TL;DR is exactly ONE sentence, bolded with `**…**`.
- Overview is 2-3 sentences. No more.
- Body word count ≤ 350 (excluding markers + connector prose). Connectors are tight one-liners; deep prose belongs inside the relevant module's data, not in the body.
- If you cannot satisfy any module's selection rule (extreme thin-data topic), pick `key_facts` only and write a minimal body containing only `<<MODULE:key_facts>>`.

## Narrative-article rules (the new heart of the page)

The `narrative_sections` array is the new SPOTLIGHT of every page — a multi-section article that EXPLAINS the topic the way Wikipedia, DeepWiki, or Notion would. The existing modules become a Reference & Evidence appendix below.

**Section structure**:
- Each section has a unique `anchor` (kebab-case, ≤ 24 chars), a `heading` (human readable, sentence case), and a `paragraphs` array.
- Section titles MUST emerge from the cluster's actual content. Do NOT pick from a fixed template menu. Examples of good content-driven titles: "Integrate OpenClaw with Beever Atlas", "Mattermost as the primary platform", "Future BigQuery integration". Bad titles (template bias): "Context", "Overview", "Background" when the data does not support that framing.
- Sections render in the order you list them — put foundational / definitional sections first; forward-looking / open-questions sections last.
- Aim for 3-7 sections per page. 1-2 sections reads as a stub; 8+ sections reads as a kitchen sink.

**Paragraph structure**:
- Each paragraph is 3-5 sentences. Active voice. Short.
- `text`: the paragraph prose. State insights and conclusions directly — synthesise, don't narrate.
- `citations`: array of fact_ids cited inline within `text`. Format inline as `[f_xxx]` so the frontend renders citation chips.
- `is_inference`: set to `true` for SYNTHESIS paragraphs that interpret beyond direct facts (e.g., "These decisions together suggest a shift toward enterprise"). Inference paragraphs MUST still cite ≥1 fact_id grounding the inference — uncited inference is hallucination and will be dropped.

**Citation discipline (HARD RULES)**:
- EVERY paragraph MUST cite at least one fact_id. Uncited paragraphs are DROPPED by the validator.
- Inference paragraphs (`is_inference: true`) MUST still cite ≥1 fact_id.
- FORBIDDEN narration phrases (paragraphs containing these are DROPPED): "shared a link", "shared an article", "noted that", "mentioned that", "posted about", "presented that". Do NOT write activity-log narration.
- GOOD: "The team adopted Authlib for OAuth/OIDC because of its modern OIDC discovery [f_1]."
- BAD: "Thomas Chong shared a link to Authlib [f_1]."
- The article's overall citation coverage MUST be ≥ 80% — articles below that threshold are REJECTED and the page falls back to module-only rendering.

**Word caps**:
- Each section: 150-400 words. Sections over 400 words are TRUNCATED at sentence boundary.
- Total article: 1,500-3,000 words for typical topic pages, up to 5,000 for landmark pages (channel overview). The validator HARD-rejects articles over 6,000 words.
- Be concise like a Wikipedia editor — every paragraph adds new information. NO padding.

**Visual guidance per section (NOT optional when content fits)**:

When a section's content has any of these shapes, you MUST include the matching visual:

- **Comparison / options** (2+ alternatives, trade-offs, before/after) → `table` with headers
- **Sequence / process / workflow / pipeline** → `mermaid` `graph TD` or ordered `list`
- **Architecture / system relationships / data flow** → `mermaid` `graph TD` with labeled edges
- **Enumeration of 4+ items** (libraries, decisions, contributors, milestones) → bulleted `list`
- **Statement of importance / quote / direct claim worth highlighting** → `blockquote`
- **Code / config / command snippet** → `code` block

Default to including a visual — every section is more readable with one. Set `visual: null` ONLY when the section is purely interpretive prose (no comparison, sequence, architecture, enumeration, or quotable claim).

Allowed kinds: `table`, `mermaid`, `list`, `callout`, `code`, `blockquote`.

Visual shape:
- `{{"kind": "table", "content": {{"headers": ["A", "B"], "rows": [["1", "2"]]}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "mermaid", "content": "graph TD\\n  A[Foo] --> B[Bar]"}}`
- `{{"kind": "list", "content": {{"ordered": false, "items": ["one", "two", "three"]}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "callout", "content": {{"variant": "warning|info|tip", "text": "..."}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "code", "content": {{"language": "python", "code": "..."}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "blockquote", "content": {{"text": "...", "attribution": "Speaker"}}}}`

Visuals sit INLINE within the section, not at the article footer. At most ONE visual per section.

**Agent voice**:
- Third-person synthetic voice. Wikipedia-editor style. NO "I", "we", "our".
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences). Active voice. Active verbs name the outcome.
- No jargon without explanation. Define acronyms on first use.
- NO "shared a link" / "noted that" narration — see forbidden phrases above.
- Cite every claim with [f_xxx] inline.

## Worked examples

GOOD section (Topic archetype, content-driven title):
```
{{
  "anchor": "openclaw-integration",
  "heading": "Integrate OpenClaw with Beever Atlas",
  "paragraphs": [
    {{
      "text": "The team chose OpenClaw as the primary chat connector for Atlas, replacing the prior Mattermost-only adapter [f_12]. OpenClaw provides a unified push-source webhook layer covering Slack, Discord, and Teams in one HMAC-signed contract [f_15].",
      "citations": ["f_12", "f_15"],
      "is_inference": false
    }},
    {{
      "text": "This shift positions Atlas as a connector-agnostic memory layer; the IP shifts upward to the wiki + memory architecture, leaving connectors as commodity infrastructure [f_12].",
      "citations": ["f_12"],
      "is_inference": true
    }}
  ],
  "visual": null
}}
```

BAD section (template-bias, uncited paragraphs — DO NOT EMIT):
```
{{
  "anchor": "context",
  "heading": "Context",
  "paragraphs": [
    {{
      "text": "This topic discusses several important decisions about architecture and connectors.",
      "citations": [],
      "is_inference": false
    }}
  ]
}}
```
The bad example fails on three counts: (1) generic template title, (2) uncited paragraph (will be dropped), (3) vague filler that adds no information.

## Module-selection rules

- **HARD RULE — Module #1 in your plan MUST be `hero_summary` unless `fact_count` is 0.** The hero_summary frontend module reads your `tldr` and `overview` to render the page header (bold TL;DR + summary + stat strip).
- **HARD RULE — When `narrative_sections` has at least one validated section, include `narrative_article` IMMEDIATELY AFTER `hero_summary` (module #2).** The article is the new spotlight; existing modules become the appendix.
- **HARD RULE — When `archetype == "decision"`, include `decision_banner` after `narrative_article`.**
- **HARD RULE — When `tension_count` ≥ 1, include `tension_callout` after `decision_banner` (or after `narrative_article` on Topic-archetype pages).**
- **HARD RULE — When `numeric_fact_count` ≥ 3, place `stat_strip` near the top (after the spotlight modules).**
- **HARD RULE — The LAST module in your plan MUST be `provenance_drawer` whenever `fact_count` ≥ 1.** Place it AFTER `related_threads` (or at the very end).
- **HARD RULE — When `glossary_terms_used` ≥ 2, include `acronym_legend` near the END of the page (just before `provenance_drawer`).**
- **HARD RULE — When `child_count` ≥ 1, include `subpage_cards` AFTER the spine modules and BEFORE `related_threads`.**
- Pick **3 to 7 modules** total (excluding the always-present hero_summary + provenance_drawer + narrative_article).
- A module is ELIGIBLE only when its selection rule (in the catalog above) is satisfied.
- Anchors are lowercase + alphanumeric + dashes, ≤ 24 chars.

## Body authoring rules

- The body MUST contain one ``<<MODULE:<id>>>`` marker per module in your plan, in plan order.
- Optionally include a 1-2 sentence connector paragraph BEFORE each marker.
- Do NOT re-emit structured data the modules render.
- Do NOT write a "Sources" or "References" section.
- Do NOT use @ / # / $ entity prefixes — write names normally.

## Hard rules

- Output JSON ONLY. No markdown fences around the outer JSON. No prose before or after the outer object.
- TL;DR is exactly ONE sentence, bolded with `**…**`.
- Overview is 2-3 sentences. No more.
- Body word count ≤ 350 (excluding markers + connector prose). The narrative ARTICLE carries the deep prose; the body just glues markers together.
- If you cannot produce a quality narrative (extreme thin-data topic with < 4 facts), emit `narrative_sections: []` and rely on module-only rendering.

_ARCHETYPE_HINT_DECISION = """## Section structure hint — Decision archetype

This page is centered on a single decision. Decision pages typically work
well with these sections, but DEVIATE when the data does not fit:

1. **Context** — what was the situation that motivated the decision?
2. **The decision** — what was decided, by whom, when (1-2 sentences)
3. **Why** — the rationale; cite the rationale fact_id
4. **Alternatives rejected** — what else was considered; cite each alternative
5. **Implications** — what changes downstream because of this decision
6. **Open consequences** — unresolved questions or effects to monitor

If your data doesn't support 6 sections, pick the 3-4 that fit. Do NOT
fabricate sections to fill the structure. Section titles should still
be content-driven (e.g., "Why Authlib over google-auth-oauthlib" beats
"Why").

3. **Position B** — second stance, citing supporting fact_ids
4. **Common ground** — what both positions agree on (if any)

   descendant pages (cite descendant fact_ids)
3. **Major decisions** — top 3-5 decisions surfaced across descendants
4. **Cross-cutting tensions** — disagreements that span multiple sub-pages

## Narrative-article rules (the new heart of the folder page)

The `narrative_sections` array synthesises ACROSS the descendant pages — it does NOT duplicate each child's narrative. Folder narrative is the cross-cutting story: shared threads, recent shifts, top decisions, tensions spanning sub-pages.

**Section structure** (typical folder narrative):
- Each section has a unique `anchor` (kebab-case, ≤ 24 chars), a `heading` (human readable, sentence case), and a `paragraphs` array.
- Aim for 3-5 sections per folder. Sections should synthesize ACROSS descendants — not summarise each child individually.
- Section titles MUST emerge from the descendant content. Good examples: "Multi-platform connector strategy", "Memory-tier persistence decisions". Bad: generic "Overview", "Context".

**Paragraph structure**:
- Each paragraph is 3-5 sentences. Active voice. Short.
- `text`: the paragraph prose. Synthesise across descendants — name 2-3 children when their content connects.
- `citations`: array of fact_ids cited inline within `text`. Format inline as `[f_xxx]`.
- `is_inference`: set to `true` for SYNTHESIS paragraphs that interpret beyond direct facts. Inference paragraphs MUST still cite ≥1 fact_id.

**Citation discipline (HARD RULES)**:
- EVERY paragraph MUST cite at least one fact_id. Uncited paragraphs are DROPPED.
- Inference paragraphs (`is_inference: true`) MUST still cite ≥1 fact_id.
- FORBIDDEN narration phrases (paragraphs containing these are DROPPED): "shared a link", "shared an article", "noted that", "mentioned that", "posted about", "presented that".
- Article citation coverage MUST be ≥ 80%; below that, the article is REJECTED and the page falls back to module-only rendering.

**Word caps**:
- Each section: 150-400 words. Sections over 400 words are TRUNCATED.
- Total folder article: 1,500-3,000 words. Stay focused — folder narrative complements but does not replace child pages.

**Visual guidance per section (NOT optional when content fits)**:

When a section's content has any of these shapes, you MUST include the matching visual:

- **Comparison / options** (2+ alternatives, trade-offs) → `table` with headers
- **Sequence / process / workflow** → `mermaid` `graph TD` or ordered `list`
- **Architecture / cross-page relationships** → `mermaid` `graph TD` with labeled edges
- **Enumeration of 4+ items** (children, decisions, contributors) → bulleted `list`
- **Statement of importance / quote** → `blockquote`
- **Code / config snippet** → `code` block

Default to including a visual — every section is more readable with one. Set `visual: null` ONLY when the section is purely interpretive prose.

Visual shape:
- `{{"kind": "table", "content": {{"headers": ["A", "B"], "rows": [["1", "2"]]}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "mermaid", "content": "graph TD\\n  A[Foo] --> B[Bar]"}}`
- `{{"kind": "list", "content": {{"ordered": false, "items": ["one", "two", "three"]}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "callout", "content": {{"variant": "warning|info|tip", "text": "..."}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "code", "content": {{"language": "python", "code": "..."}}}}`
- `{{"kind": "blockquote", "content": {{"text": "...", "attribution": "Speaker"}}}}`

**Agent voice**:
- Third-person synthetic voice. Wikipedia-editor style. NO "I", "we", "our".
- Short paragraphs. Active voice. Active verbs name the outcome.
- Cite every claim with `[f_xxx]` inline.
- If you cannot produce a quality narrative (e.g. < 4 facts across descendants), emit `narrative_sections: []` and rely on module-only rendering.

## Module-selection rules

- **HARD RULE — Module #1 in your plan MUST be `hero_summary`.** It reads your `hero.tldr` and `hero.summary` to render the page header.
- **HARD RULE — When `narrative_sections` has at least one validated section, include `narrative_article` IMMEDIATELY AFTER `hero_summary` (module #2).**
- **HARD RULE — `subpage_cards` MUST appear** when at least one child exists. Subpage cards are the primary wayfinding device on a folder page.
- **HARD RULE — `folder_stats` MUST appear** when `child_count` ≥ 2.
- **HARD RULE — `top_contributors` SHOULD appear** when `distinct_contributor_count` ≥ 2.
- **HARD RULE — `cross_cutting_decisions` SHOULD appear** when `descendant_decision_count` ≥ 2.
- **HARD RULE — Penultimate module SHOULD be `open_questions`** when `open_question_count` ≥ 1.
- **HARD RULE — The LAST module MUST be `provenance_drawer`** when `fact_count` ≥ 1.
- A module is ELIGIBLE only when its catalog rule is satisfied — the validator will drop ineligible picks.
- Anchors are lowercase + alphanumeric + dashes, ≤ 24 chars.

## Hero authoring rules

- TL;DR is exactly ONE bold sentence (`**…**`) that names the folder's domain in concrete terms — no generic "this folder contains topics" filler.
- Summary is 2-3 sentences. Cover: (a) the throughline connecting the children, (b) who's most active, (c) any unresolved tension.
- DO NOT write a separate body — the modules render the dashboard. Hero + narrative are the only prose surfaces on the page.

## Hard rules

- Output JSON ONLY. No markdown fences around the outer JSON. No prose before or after.
- DO NOT emit the literal string "Themes & threads" — the dashboard replaces it.
- DO NOT use @ / # / $ entity prefixes — write names normally.

## Inputs

### Folder title

### Direct children (in display order)
{children_json}

### Top entities mentioned across descendants
{entities_json}

### Top-quality supporting facts
{top_facts_json}

## Task

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary of the folder"}}

The markdown body MUST:

1. Open with a 2-3 sentence intro that frames what this folder covers — the domain, the scope, why it exists. Make it specific to the children listed above; do NOT write a generic "this folder contains topics" line.

2. On its own line, include the literal token `<<CHILDREN_TOC>>`. The compiler will replace this with a navigation list AND the frontend renders it as rich cards. Each child's per-bullet summary is what populates the per-card description — write each child's `summary` (in the input) as a SINGLE COMPLETE SENTENCE (40-90 chars) that names the concrete subject of that page. Avoid trailing fragments like "covering architectural discussions, platfo" — finish the sentence.

3. After the marker, write 2-4 short paragraphs of synthesis under an implicit "themes & threads" framing — the frontend will surface them under that heading. Cover at least: (a) the most important throughline connecting the children, (b) the key contributors active across this folder and what they own, (c) any unresolved tension or open question worth flagging. Reference children by their titles. This is what makes the folder PAGE valuable beyond just its TOC.

4. Stay between **300 and 500 words** total (excluding the marker line). Folders that need more depth should rely on their child pages — the index is a wayfinding device + a synthesis layer, not a deep dive.

## Hard rules

- Output JSON ONLY. No markdown code fences. No leading or trailing prose outside the JSON.
- Use plain Markdown (no callouts, no mermaid diagrams in the index — those belong on leaf pages).
- The `summary` field is 1-2 sentences max, suitable for a card or hover preview.
- NEVER truncate a sentence with a fragment. Every sentence must end with a period (or `?`/`!`). Cut the sentence shorter rather than trail off mid-clause.
