"""Prompt templates for each wiki page type.

Design philosophy: STRUCTURE FIRST — diagrams, tables, bullet points, then supporting text.
Domain-agnostic — works for tech, community, research, personal, and enterprise channels.

Phase 4 (wiki_compiler_v2): the Key Facts table becomes a deterministic,
compiler-rendered block. The v2 prompts emit the literal marker
`<<KEY_FACTS_TABLE>>` on its own line; the compiler splices the rendered
table after `_postprocess_content`. The legacy (pre-v2) prompts are kept
intact below so `wiki_compiler_v2=OFF` behavior stays byte-identical.

OVERVIEW_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge wiki compiler. Create an **Overview** page for this channel.

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary"}}

## Content structure (follow this order strictly — INTRO FIRST, then visuals)
1. **Brief intro** — 2-3 sentences describing what this channel is about, its purpose, and the key knowledge areas it covers. THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST CONTENT. Set the context for the reader before showing any visuals.
2. **Concept map** — ```mermaid flowchart showing how the main topics/themes relate to each other. Use the topic relationships data to build accurate connections.
3. **Key Highlights table** — GFM table summarizing: total topics, decisions made, key contributors, resources shared, active period. **CRITICAL**: use the EXACT numbers from the channel-data block below — `{decisions_count}` for "Decisions Made", `{people_count}` for "Key Contributors", `{media_count}` for "Resources Shared". Do NOT recompute these from topic descriptions; the provided counts are authoritative.
4. **Topics at a glance** — bullet list of each topic with 1-line description and memory count. Topics with `"brief": true` in the data are minor/off-topic and were not given full pages — append "(brief mention)" after their entry.
5. **Key contributors** — bullet list of most active people and their roles/expertise
6. **Tools & resources** — if technologies or tools data exists, show as bullet list or GFM table. Skip this section entirely if no tools/technologies are relevant.
7. **Recent momentum** — 2-3 sentences on what's currently active or changing. Reference the activity summary data.

## Writing style
- **Synthesize, don't narrate.** Transform raw facts into insights. Write "The team identified context graphs as a key architecture pattern for agent safety [1]" — NOT "Jacky Chan shared a link about context graphs [1]".
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "shared an article", "posted about", "mentioned that", "noted that", "presented a". These produce activity-log narration, not knowledge.
- Avoid filler phrases that add no information: "crucial for", "under discussion", "actively testing", "plays a key role in", "is a subject of ongoing", "highlights the importance of". Replace with concrete verbs naming the specific outcome or blocker.
- Lead with the INSIGHT or CONCLUSION, then cite the source. The reader wants to know what matters, not who posted what.
- Use active voice describing the knowledge itself: "Context graphs prevent agents from using expired data [3]" — not "It was shared that context graphs prevent..."
- When multiple people contributed to a theme, synthesize their collective input rather than listing each person's individual share.

## Adaptive instructions
- Adapt your language to match the channel's domain. If the data is technical, use technical terms. If it's a community or personal channel, use appropriate casual language.
- The concept map should reflect the actual relationships in the data — don't force a technical "architecture" if the channel discusses non-technical topics.
- Only include sections where data exists. If there are no technologies, skip "Tools & resources". If there are no decisions, don't mention them prominently.

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each numbered section above MUST be a ## heading (e.g. `## Concept Map`, `## Key Highlights`). Use ### for sub-sections within them. This creates a navigable table of contents.
- Use ```mermaid for diagrams. Keep syntax SIMPLE — use ONLY `graph TD` with `ID[Label] --> ID[Label]` edges. Every node MUST use a short ID with a descriptive label: `DS[Data Sources]` not just `Data Sources`. FORBIDDEN: subgraph, end, style, classDef, parentheses inside brackets, quotes inside labels, `-- text -->` dash-space style labels, semicolons, chained arrows like `A --> B --> C` (use separate lines: `A --> B` then `B --> C`). USE `-->|label|` pipe-style to label edges (e.g., `A -->|uses| B`). Example: `graph TD\n    DS[Data Sources] -->|feeds| PR[Processing]\n    PR -->|outputs| ST[Storage]`. **Every ```mermaid block MUST end with a line containing only ``` (three backticks) — never leave a mermaid block unclosed.**
- Use ```chart for data charts with exact JSON: {{"type":"donut","title":"...","data":[{{"name":"X","value":N}}],"xKey":"name","series":["value"]}}
- Use GFM tables for structured data. ALWAYS include the header separator row. Example:\n  | Column A | Column B |\n  |----------|----------|\n  | value 1  | value 2  |
- Use bullet points over paragraphs when listing facts
- Add [N] citation markers on factual claims. **Maximum 3 citations per sentence** — never list long chains. (use actual numbers: [1], [2], [3]). **Maximum 3 citation markers per sentence.** If a claim has many sources, pick the 2-3 most relevant — do NOT list long chains like [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] or [1][2][5][6][8][9][10]. Long citation chains clutter the text and are unreadable. **CRITICAL: Key contributors bullets may have at most 3 [N] markers total — pick the most representative citations and stop.**
- Do NOT use @, #, or $ prefixes for entity names — just write names normally
- If media (images/PDFs/links) exist, embed important ones with a brief description line BEFORE each embed explaining what it shows: `**Dashboard Overview** — Key metrics for the project.` then `![Dashboard](url)` on the next line. Do NOT use bare bullet points with just a link.
- Use ONLY inline [N] markers for citations. Do NOT generate any source list, reference section, citation block, or numbered bibliography — the UI renders citations separately. FORBIDDEN at end of content: `## Sources`, `### Sources`, `- [1] @Author...`, `[1]: Author...`.
- Keep output concise and readable: avoid repeated sections, avoid repeating the same link/title in multiple sections, and keep each bullet to one idea.
- Preserve canonical naming from provided data (do not invent alternate spellings like different bot/product names).
- **Maximum 15 edges** in the concept map mermaid diagram. Show only the strongest topic relationships — do NOT connect every topic to every other topic.
- **Maximum 10 tools** in the Tools & Resources section. Only list tools mentioned by 2+ people or in 3+ facts. Exclude generic tools like messaging apps (Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage), operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows), and text editors (VS Code).

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary"}}

## Content structure (follow this order strictly — TL;DR FIRST, then DIAGRAM, then text)
1. **TL;DR** — A single bold sentence summarizing the key insight of this topic. THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST LINE. Example: `**Multi-agent systems fail primarily due to inadequate memory engineering, not limited context windows.**`
2. **Concept diagram** — ```mermaid diagram showing how the key entities (people, decisions, concepts) relate within this topic. Use the entity relationships data to build accurate connections.
3. **Key Facts** — GFM table with columns: Fact, Source, Type, Importance — showing the most important facts with [N] citations
4. **Overview** — 2-3 sentences summarizing this topic: what it covers, why it matters, and its current state (AFTER the diagram and table)
5. **Decisions & outcomes** — if decisions exist, show as GFM table with columns: Decision, Status, Made By, Date. Use status badges: ✅ active, ❌ superseded, ⏳ pending. Skip if no decisions.
6. **Contributors** — bullet list of people involved with their roles (decision maker, contributor, expert, mentioned)
7. **Tools & resources** — if technologies/tools exist, bullet list. Skip if none.
8. **Current state & open questions** — what's resolved vs. still open. Use bullet points. Each open question MUST include when it was first raised (e.g., "(raised Jan 2026)") so readers can assess staleness.
9. **Media & Resources** — if media exists, each item MUST have a brief description line explaining what it shows/contains BEFORE the embed/link. Format: `**Dashboard Screenshot** — Shows the Insights dashboard with memory health metrics.` followed by `![Dashboard](url)`. Do NOT use bare bullet points with just a link. Skip if none.
10. **See Also** — if related topics exist, list them as bullet points with their titles. Format: `- **[Related Topic Title]**` — one line each. Skip if no related topics.

## Writing style
- **Synthesize, don't narrate.** Write "The team adopted a wiki-first architecture for 10x cost reduction [1]" — NOT "Thomas Chong shared that the wiki-first architecture offers cost reduction [1]".
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "shared an article", "posted about", "mentioned that", "noted that", "presented a", "highlighted that". These produce activity-log narration.
- AVOID filler phrases: "crucial for", "under discussion", "actively testing", "plays a key role in", "is a subject of ongoing", "highlights the importance of", "paves the way for", "underscores the need". Replace with concrete verbs naming the specific outcome, blocker, or unresolved question.
- Lead with the INSIGHT, then cite. The reader wants knowledge, not a timeline of who said what.
- In the Key Facts table, state the fact itself — not "Person X observed that [fact]". Write the fact directly.
- When listing open questions, include when the question was raised (e.g., "(raised Jan 2026)") so readers can assess staleness.

## Adaptive instructions
- The concept diagram should reflect actual entities and relationships from this topic — not a generic template
- If this topic is about a technical system, show system relationships. If about a community event, show event logistics. If about research, show methodology flow. Adapt to the content.
- Prioritize showing high-quality, high-importance facts in the Key Facts table
- Every factual claim MUST have a [N] citation marker

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each numbered section above MUST be a ## heading (e.g. `## Concept Diagram`, `## Key Facts`). Use ### for sub-sections. This creates a navigable table of contents.
- ALWAYS include at least one ```mermaid diagram. Keep syntax SIMPLE — use ONLY `graph TD` with `ID[Label] --> ID[Label]` edges. Every node MUST use a short ID with a descriptive label: `AG[AI Agent]` not just `AI Agent`. FORBIDDEN: subgraph, end, style, classDef, parentheses inside brackets, quotes inside labels, `-- text -->` dash-space style labels, semicolons, chained arrows like `A --> B --> C` (use separate lines). USE `-->|label|` pipe-style to label edges with relationship type (e.g., `A -->|uses| B`, `A -->|decided| B`, `A -->|depends on| B`).
- Use ```chart for quantitative data with JSON: {{"type":"bar","title":"...","data":[...],"xKey":"name","series":["value"]}}
- Prefer tables and bullet points over long paragraphs
- Add [N] citation markers (actual numbers) on every factual claim. **Maximum 3 citations per sentence** — pick the most relevant, never list long chains like [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Do NOT use @, #, or $ prefixes — write entity names normally
- If media exists, embed: ![desc](url) for images, [name](url) for docs/links
- Use ONLY inline [N] markers for citations. Do NOT generate any source list, reference section, citation block, or numbered bibliography — the UI renders citations separately. FORBIDDEN at end of content: `## Sources`, `### Sources`, `- [1] @Author...`, `[1]: Author...`.
- Keep the page focused: maximum 8 rows in Key Facts; avoid duplicate facts across Key Facts and Details.
- Preserve canonical naming from provided data; do not alternate spellings for the same entity.
- **Maximum 12 edges** in the concept diagram. Focus on the most important entity relationships.

4. **Contributors table** — GFM table with columns: Name, Role/Expertise, Topics Active In, Key Contributions, Decisions Made
5. **Collaboration patterns** — bullet points on notable collaboration patterns, expertise clusters, and knowledge areas

## Writing style
- Describe what each person DOES and KNOWS — not what they "shared" or "posted". Write "Thomas Chong drives architecture decisions for Beever Atlas [1]" — NOT "Thomas Chong shared several messages about architecture [1]".
- In the Contributors table, "Key Contributions" should describe impact (e.g., "Designed the memory hierarchy and led database selection") — not activity (e.g., "Shared 14 messages across 8 topics").
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "posted about", "mentioned that". AVOID filler: "crucial for", "under discussion", "actively testing", "plays a key role in".

## Adaptive instructions
- Use "Contributors" and "Experts" language rather than "Team members" — this works for open communities, research groups, and enterprise teams alike
- The mermaid diagram should show actual relationships from the edge data: who DECIDED what, who WORKS_ON what, who USES which tools
- If the channel has few people (1-3), keep the diagram simple. For larger groups (5+), focus on the most active contributors.

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading

     A: [answer text] [N]

   - After the last Q&A in a topic group, add a `---` horizontal rule to visually separate it from the next section.
4. **Related pages** — bullet list suggesting which wiki pages have more detail on each topic

Good: "MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) standardizes how AI agents call Beever Atlas capabilities through a unified interface. It separates tool invocation (MCP) from guidance/instructions (Skills), enabling agents to interact with the system without custom integrations [1]."
- Answers should help someone UNDERSTAND the topic, not just confirm it exists.
- **Verbatim reuse**: if a candidate question already has an `answer` field containing 2+ sentences with citation markers, reuse that answer **verbatim** (preserve its wording and `[N]` citations). Only rewrite when the candidate answer is <2 sentences, lacks citations, or is clearly malformed.
- Each Q&A pair must be visually separated with a blank line before and after the answer — never run Q&A pairs together in a single paragraph.
- FORBIDDEN: 1-sentence answers that merely restate who said what.

## Adaptive instructions
- These Q&A pairs were extracted from actual channel discussions — they represent real questions people asked and answers that emerged
- Include ALL provided FAQ candidates. Only deduplicate if two questions from different topics are nearly identical (>90% overlap in meaning) — in that case merge and cite both sources.
- If no FAQ candidates exist at all, produce: "No frequently asked questions have emerged from channel discussions yet. As more conversations happen, common questions and their answers will appear here."
- Order questions within each topic by relevance/importance, not chronologically

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each topic group MUST be a ## heading. Individual Q&A pairs use bold **Q:** formatting on their own line, with the answer on a separate paragraph. Do NOT use ### subheadings for individual Q&As. This creates a navigable table of contents.

1. **Relationship diagram** — if 5+ terms exist, include a ```mermaid diagram showing how terms relate to each other (which terms are used together, which are sub-concepts of others). THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST CONTENT ELEMENT (skip if fewer than 5 terms — start with Introduction instead).
2. **Introduction** — 1 sentence: "Key terms, acronyms, and concepts used in this channel."
3. **Terms table** — GFM table with columns: Term, Definition, First Mentioned By, Related Topics. Sort alphabetically. In the "First Mentioned By" column, write "—" when the source is unknown; NEVER write placeholder markers like `(Implicit)`, `(Inferred)`, `(Unknown)`, `(N/A)`, or any parenthesized guess.
4. **Category breakdown** — if terms naturally group into categories (e.g., technical terms, process terms, domain terms), add a brief categorized list after the table

## Writing style
- Define each term in the context of THIS CHANNEL, not as a generic dictionary entry. Bad: "Neo4j is a graph database management system." Good: "Neo4j is used as the primary knowledge graph store for Beever Atlas, storing entity relationships extracted from channel conversations."
- Every definition should answer: "What is this AND how does this channel use it?"
- FORBIDDEN: Generic definitions that could come from Wikipedia. Always tie back to channel context.

## Adaptive instructions
- Glossary terms can be anything channel-specific: technical jargon, project codenames, acronyms, community slang, research terminology, business terms
- Enrich definitions where the provided data is thin — add context about how the term is used in this channel specifically
- If no glossary terms exist, produce: "No channel-specific terms have been identified yet. As more specialized vocabulary emerges in discussions, it will be cataloged here."
- Cross-reference related topics where possible

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)
- Each numbered section above MUST be a ## heading (e.g. `## Terms`, `## Relationship Diagram`). Use ### for sub-sections or categories. This creates a navigable table of contents.
- Use GFM tables for the main term list — this is the primary content
- Use ```mermaid for the relationship diagram. Keep syntax SIMPLE — use ONLY `graph TD` with `ID[Label] --> ID[Label]` edges. Every node MUST use a short ID with a descriptive label. FORBIDDEN: subgraph, end, style, classDef, parentheses inside brackets, quotes inside labels, `-- text -->` dash-space style labels, semicolons, chained arrows like `A --> B --> C` (use separate lines). USE `-->|label|` pipe-style to label edges with relationship type (e.g., `A -->|uses| B`, `A -->|decided| B`).
- Do NOT use @, #, $ prefixes — write names normally
- Use ONLY inline [N] markers for citations. Do NOT generate any source list, reference section, citation block, or numbered bibliography — the UI renders citations separately. FORBIDDEN at end of content: `## Sources`, `### Sources`, `- [1] @Author...`, `[1]: Author...`.

1. **Media distribution** — ```chart donut chart showing the count of each media type (images, documents, links, videos). THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST CONTENT ELEMENT.
2. **Resources table** — GFM table with columns: Name, Type, Shared By, Context, Link — show only the most useful items (max 40 rows), prioritized by relevance and diversity of sources
3. **Overview** — 1-2 sentences summarizing what resources have been shared in this channel (AFTER chart and table)
4. **Images** — if images exist, show only top 10. Each image MUST have a brief description line BEFORE the embed explaining what the image shows and why it's useful, then the embed on a new line. Format:\n   `**Beever Atlas Insights Dashboard** — Shows key metrics including total memories, queries, and cost savings for the project.`\n   `![Beever Atlas Insights Dashboard](url)`\n   Skip if none.
5. **Documents** — if PDFs/docs exist, show only top 10. Each document MUST have a brief description explaining what information it contains and how it helps, followed by the link.

Format:\n   `**Context Graphs vs Knowledge Graphs** — Explains how context graphs preserve decision context for AI agents, a key architectural reference. [Read article](url)`\n   Skip if none.
7. **Videos** — if videos exist, show with brief description and link. Skip if none.

## Writing style
- In the Context column and section descriptions, explain WHY a resource matters — not just that it was shared. Write "Architecture reference for the 3-tier memory hierarchy design" — NOT "Thomas Chong shared this image."
- Group related resources thematically (e.g., "Memory System Research", "Project Mockups") rather than just by media type.
- FORBIDDEN phrases: "shared a link", "shared an article", "posted about".

## Adaptive instructions
- Group resources by type for easy scanning
- Include the context in which each resource was shared — what was the discussion about when this was posted?
- For images, always embed with ![desc](url) so they render inline
- For documents and links, use [name](url) format
- If a resource was referenced by multiple people or in multiple contexts, note that

## Rules
- Do NOT start with a # heading (title rendered separately)

- Use ```chart for the distribution with JSON: {{"type":"donut","title":"Resources by Type","data":[{{"name":"Images","value":5}}],"xKey":"name","series":["value"]}}
- Use GFM tables for the overview listing
- Add [N] citation markers where applicable. **Maximum 3 citations per sentence.**
- Do NOT use @, #, $ prefixes — write names normally
- Remove obvious low-signal/noise links and malformed/truncated duplicates (e.g. same URL/title repeated with ellipsis variants).
- Ensure type is correct: markdown docs are documents/files, not images.
- Use ONLY inline [N] markers for citations. Do NOT generate any source list, reference section, citation block, or numbered bibliography — the UI renders citations separately. FORBIDDEN at end of content: `## Sources`, `### Sources`, `- [1] @Author...`, `[1]: Author...`.
- **Maximum 30 items total** across all sections. Prioritize items with descriptive names and clear context.

- **Size-based bias**: Readers cannot navigate a 40+ row Key Facts table. If `fact_count` ≥ 40, you MUST return `needs_subpages: true` and partition into 2–5 sub-pages even if the theme feels unified — there will always be sub-themes worth separating (by entity, by phase, by platform, by decision vs. discussion, etc.).

#   - Folder slugs MUST be kebab-case ASCII and MUST NOT collide with
#     any cluster id.
#   - Maximum tree depth is 4. Prefer depth 2-3 unless a strong

STRUCTURE_PLANNER_PROMPT = """You are an information architect organizing a knowledge wiki for a chat channel.

The wiki has many topic pages. Your job is to decide how to **group them into folders** so the operator can navigate efficiently. A folder is a first-class wiki page with its own synthesized index AND a list of child pages (sub-folders or leaf topics).

## Inputs

### Channel narrative
{channel_summary}

### Topic clusters (you MUST place each exactly once in your output)
{cluster_index_json}

### Heuristic candidate groups (deterministic clusters discovered from prefix similarity, entity overlap, and co-citation density)
{candidates_json}

## Your task

Produce a JSON object with this exact shape:

{{
  "folders": [
    {{
      "slug": "kebab-case-folder-id",
      "title": "Human Folder Name",
      "child_slugs": ["cluster-id-1", "cluster-id-2"],
      "rationale": "1-line explanation of why these belong together"
    }}
  ],
  "leaves": ["cluster-id-3", "cluster-id-4"]
}}

## Hard rules

1. **Every cluster id from the input list MUST appear exactly once** — either inside one folder's `child_slugs`, OR in `leaves`. Never both. Never neither.
2. **Folder slugs MUST be kebab-case ASCII** (e.g., `beever-atlas`, `security`, `growth-marketing`). NO spaces, NO uppercase, NO underscores.
3. **Folder slugs MUST NOT collide with any cluster id.** Check before naming.
4. **Maximum depth = 4.** A folder may contain other folders, but the deepest nested folder may have leaves at most 4 levels from the root.
5. **Default to depth 2.** Only nest a folder inside another folder when the inner group is genuinely a sub-domain (e.g., "GitHub" inside "Beever Atlas").
6. **Use the candidate groups as a strong prior.** Confirm them, rename them, expand them, or split them — but don't invent radically different groupings unless the candidates clearly miss a pattern.
7. **Output JSON ONLY.** No markdown code fences. No leading or trailing prose. Just the JSON object.

## Quality bar

- A folder is worth creating only when it has 3+ children OR the children form a self-contained domain a reader would explore together.
- Folder titles should read like Notion section names: short, scannable, capitalized normally ("Security", "Growth Campaigns", "Beever Atlas").
- Singletons stay in `leaves` — never wrap a single cluster in a folder.

# the folder and where to look for what.
#
# Critical contract: the output MUST contain the literal token

{entities_json}

### Top-quality supporting facts

## Task

Return JSON: {{"content": "markdown string", "summary": "1-2 sentence summary of the folder"}}

The markdown body MUST:

1. Open with a 2-3 sentence intro that frames what this folder covers — the domain, the scope, why it exists. Make it specific to the children listed above; do NOT write a generic "this folder contains topics" line.

2. On its own line, include the literal token `<<CHILDREN_TOC>>`. The compiler will replace this with a deterministic table of contents of the direct children — DO NOT write the TOC yourself, just emit the marker.

3. After the marker, write 1-3 short paragraphs that highlight the most important threads connecting the children (shared people, recurring decisions, key tensions, or open questions). Reference children by their titles. This is what makes the folder PAGE valuable beyond just its TOC.

4. Stay between **200 and 400 words** total (excluding the marker line). Folders that need more depth should rely on their child pages — the index is a wayfinding device, not a deep dive.

## Hard rules

- Output JSON ONLY. No markdown code fences. No leading or trailing prose outside the JSON.
- Use plain Markdown (no callouts, no mermaid diagrams in the index — those belong on leaf pages).
- The `summary` field is 1-2 sentences max, suitable for a card or hover preview.
