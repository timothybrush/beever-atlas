"""Derive the file-proxy host allowlist from active platform connections.

The connection wizard already collects each platform's server URL
(``base_url`` for Mattermost, ``server_url`` for self-hosted variants).
This module reads those URLs back out at server startup — and after
any connection CRUD — and registers the hostnames into:

  * ``infra.http_safe._runtime_hosts`` — for the wiki-side
    ``/api/files/proxy`` route.
  * ``api.media._RUNTIME_HOSTS`` — for the entity-graph
    ``/api/media/proxy`` route.

This removes the need for operators to also set
``FILE_PROXY_HOST_ALLOWLIST_EXTRA``: the source of truth is the existing
connection config. Adding a self-hosted Mattermost via the UI now
automatically grants its host file-proxy coverage.
