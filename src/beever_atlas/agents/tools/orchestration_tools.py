"""ADK-style orchestration tools for the QA agent (deep mode).

These tools wrap the framework-neutral capabilities in
``beever_atlas.capabilities`` so the internal QA agent can list
connections, list channels, trigger sync jobs, refresh the wiki, and
poll job status — all with the same access-control guarantees as the
MCP surface.

Principal identity propagation
-------------------------------
ADK tool functions receive only their declared keyword arguments; there
is no implicit session context injected by the framework.  We propagate
the calling user's ``principal_id`` through a request-scoped
``ContextVar`` (``_current_principal_id``) that the ``_run_agent_stream``
runner sets once per QA turn, before handing control to the LLM.

Callers (``api/ask.py``) must call ``bind_principal(user_id)`` and reset
the token at turn end — the same pattern used by ``follow_ups_tool.py``
for its collector.

Write-side safety
-----------------
``trigger_sync_tool`` and ``refresh_wiki_tool`` are intentionally named
so that the ``_UNTRUSTED_TOOL_DENYLIST_FRAGMENTS`` filter in
``qa_agent.py`` (extended in Phase 6 to include ``"sync"`` and
``"refresh"``) removes them when retrieved context is untrusted.
Read-only tools (``list_connections_tool``, ``list_channels_tool``,
``get_job_status_tool``) are preserved under untrusted context.
