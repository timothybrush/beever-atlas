"""Graph memory tools: entity relationships, decision history, expert ranking.

This module exposes three async tools that let the QA agent reason over the
knowledge graph (Neo4j / Nebula). All three are decorated with
``@cite_tool_output`` so the citation registry can assign stable ``_src_id``
handles to every returned row.

Return-shape contracts (see TypedDicts below):
    * ``search_relationships``  -> RelationshipSearchResult  (dict)
    * ``trace_decision_history`` -> list[DecisionEvent]       (list of dicts)
    * ``find_experts``           -> list[ExpertHit]           (list of dicts)

Empty-graph sentinel: list-returning tools emit ``[{"_empty": True, ...}]``
rather than a bare ``[]`` so the citation decorator's list-branch (see
``_citation_decorator.py:68-75``) skips annotation but the agent still has a
structured hint about the failure mode.

Name freeze: the three public coroutine names are locked by Stream 1's
``test_allowed_tools_exist_in_registry`` — do NOT rename.

    """Traverse the knowledge graph for relationships between named entities.

    **Purpose.** Resolve each entity name to a canonical node (fuzzy match),
    then merge the ``hops``-radius neighbourhoods into a single deduplicated
    subgraph of nodes and edges. Useful for answering *"how is X connected to
    Y?"* style questions.

    **When to use.**
    - The question names 1-3 concrete entities (people, projects, tech) and
      asks how they relate.
    - You need structured edges with relationship types and confidence, not
      free-text facts.

    **When NOT to use.**
    - The question is broad / exploratory ("tell me about X"): prefer
      ``search_channel_facts`` or ``get_topic_overview``.
    - You need temporal ordering of decisions: use
      ``trace_decision_history``.
    - You need ranked people by expertise: use ``find_experts``.

    Cost: ~$0.005. Target latency: ~500ms.

    Args:
        channel_id: Scope traversal context (used for logging / citations).
        entities: 1-N entity names to resolve and traverse from.
        hops: Graph-traversal radius (default 2).

    Returns:
        A :class:`RelationshipSearchResult` dict. Nodes capped at 20 and
        edges at 50 — overflow is dropped lowest-confidence first. The
        citation-decorator fields (``text``, ``subject_id``, ``predicate``,
        ``object_id``, ``channel_id``) are always populated.

        On an empty graph the sentinel ``[{"_empty": True, "entity": ...,
        "reason": "no_edges"}]`` is returned instead (kept for parity with
        the list-returning tools so that the citation decorator's list
        branch short-circuits on ``_empty``).

    **When to use.**
    - The question asks *"what did we decide about X, and has it changed?"*
