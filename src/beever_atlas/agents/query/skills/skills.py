"""Inline QA agent skill pack (ADK progressive disclosure).

Each `Skill` is defined inline with keyword-frontloaded descriptions and
short L2 `instructions`. Heavy L3 formatting templates live as `.md`
files in `resources/` and are referenced by filename — the ADK
`load_resource` tool fetches them on demand.

The pack is built once at module load and cached.
