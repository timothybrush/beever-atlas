"""ADK tool: suggest_follow_ups.

Replaces the legacy prose-JSON FOLLOW_UPS regex antipattern with a
typed tool call. The agent is expected to invoke this at the end of its
turn with 1–3 contextual follow-up questions.

The tool stashes questions on a request-scoped collector (contextvar).
`_run_agent_stream` reads the collector after turn_complete and emits
the existing `follow_ups` SSE event from the typed list.

When `citation_registry_enabled=False`, the agent is not configured
with this tool, so the legacy regex path keeps running unchanged.
