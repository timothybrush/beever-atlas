FACT_EXTRACTOR_INSTRUCTION: str = """\
## Language Directive
The source messages are predominantly in {source_language} (BCP-47 tag).
Write every extracted fact's `memory_text` in {source_language}.
Preserve proper nouns (people names, project codenames, tool/technology
names, company names) VERBATIM — do not translate or transliterate them.
When a message contains code-switching (e.g. Cantonese with English
technical terms like "deployment", "PR", "staging"), keep the mixed form
as-is; do NOT convert one language to the other.
Language-agnostic calibration example (Cantonese, zh-HK):
  Message: "阿明今日話佢搞掂咗個 deployment，但 staging 個 DB migration 仲未 run"
  Fact memory_text: "阿明完成咗個 deployment，但 staging 嘅 DB migration 仲未 run，令到今日嘅 release 未可以 cut"
  Notes: people names (阿明), tech terms (deployment, staging, DB migration),
  and native particles (咗/嘅) are all preserved.

## Role
You are a fact-extraction engine for a workspace memory system.

## Relevance Principle: The 6-Month Test
Before writing any fact, ask: "Would a new team member joining in 6 months need this
to understand what the team decided, built, learned, or is working on?"
A fact passes if it helps them understand team decisions, progress, or blockers.
A fact fails if it reads like a database log entry, contains raw system identifiers,
or could be re-derived trivially from re-reading the original message.

## Context
Channel: {channel_name}
Messages (preprocessed, JSON array):
{preprocessed_messages}

## Task
For each message, extract 0–{max_facts_per_message} discrete, self-contained facts.

### What is a fact?
A fact is a concise statement that:
- Stands alone without surrounding context — anyone reading it months later understands it.
- Reads like a teammate's written recap note, not a database record.
- Captures WHO did/said/decided WHAT and implicitly WHEN (use natural language: "March 2026").
- Is anchored to a specific claim, decision, blocker, action item, or piece of technical knowledge.

### Writing style
- Use display names (e.g. "Jordan"), NOT raw user IDs or username handles.
- Use natural dates ("March 2026", "last Tuesday"), NOT epoch strings or ISO-8601 timestamps.
- Write like a teammate summarising a thread, NOT like a structured log insert.
- One crisp sentence beats two vague ones.

### Writing style — synthesized knowledge, NOT activity log

Each fact's ``memory_text`` MUST state the underlying knowledge as a
declarative, third-person sentence. Do NOT narrate WHO shared/posted/
mentioned/noted what.

FORBIDDEN phrases (drop these — they're activity-log narration):
- "shared a link"
- "shared an article"
- "shared a [Neo4j blog] post"
- "shared a [GitHub] repository"
- "noted that"
- "mentioned that"
- "posted about"
- "presented that"
- "asked the team..."  (when followed by a clarification — extract the underlying question, not the act of asking)

GOOD examples:
- "The team adopted Authlib over google-auth-oauthlib for its modern OIDC discovery."
- "Ory Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect provider that the team is evaluating as an authentication backend."
- "fastapi-sso provides OAuth integration patterns relevant to the FastAPI authentication strategy."
- "The Neo4j blog post 'Build AI Agents that Make Better Decisions on GCP' describes a pattern combining Neo4j graph context with GCP-hosted agents — relevant to Beever Atlas's planned architecture."

BAD examples (will cause the fact to be rejected):
- "Thomas Chong shared a link to the GitHub repository for Ory Hydra."  ← who-narrative; rewrite as "Ory Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 + OIDC provider..."
- "Jacky Chan mentioned that fastapi-sso could be useful."  ← rewrite as "fastapi-sso could provide OAuth integration patterns for the FastAPI auth strategy."
- "Thomas Chong shared a Neo4j blog post titled..."  ← rewrite as "The Neo4j blog post '...' describes a pattern combining..."

When the source message IS just a link share (no surrounding context), still synthesize: state what the linked resource IS or DOES, not who shared it. The author is preserved separately in ``author_name`` — do not duplicate that into ``memory_text``.

When you cannot determine what a link/resource IS without speculation, set the fact's ``importance`` to "low" and write a minimal description. Do NOT fabricate context.

---

### Skip criteria — return empty facts for messages that are:
- Purely social: greetings, farewells, acknowledgements ("ok", "thanks", "got it", "+1")
- Emoji-only or reaction-only
- Channel join/leave notifications
- Status updates with no informational content ("brb", "back", "afk")
- Off-topic: not about team work, projects, decisions, or shared knowledge
  (e.g. casual sports chat, personal announcements unrelated to work)
- Exact duplicates of information already captured in another fact

---

### Quality scoring (quality_score: 0.0–1.0)
Score each fact by averaging three dimensions (each 0.0–1.0):
- **Specificity**: 0.0 = vague generality, 1.0 = precise, quantified, named claim
- **Actionability**: 0.0 = pure trivia, 1.0 = directly drives a decision or next step
- **Verifiability**: 0.0 = unverifiable opinion, 1.0 = objectively checkable

quality_score = (specificity + actionability + verifiability) / 3

Drop any fact with quality_score < 0.5. Scores MUST vary — not every fact is 0.9.

---

### Calibration examples

**HIGH (0.90)** — decision with rationale and alternatives:
  "Alice decided to use Redis for session caching after evaluating Memcached, citing pub/sub support for real-time invalidation and built-in persistence for session recovery"
  — Specificity 0.95, Actionability 0.9, Verifiability 0.85 → 0.90

**HIGH (0.85)** — observation with significance and impact:
  "API latency on the /search endpoint reached 200ms, exceeding the 150ms SLA threshold and triggering discussion about adding a caching layer"
  — Specificity 0.9, Actionability 0.8, Verifiability 0.85 → 0.85

**MEDIUM (0.70)** — action item with motivation and deadline:
  "Bob needs to update the API docs before the v2.1 release on Friday to unblock the partner integration team"
  — Specificity 0.75, Actionability 0.8, Verifiability 0.55 → 0.70

**MEDIUM (0.63)** — question with full context:
  "Bob asked whether the team should migrate the /search API from REST to GraphQL, motivated by the mobile app's need for flexible field selection"
  — Specificity 0.7, Actionability 0.6, Verifiability 0.6 → 0.63

**TOO THIN (0.40)** — decision without rationale (lacks the *why*):
  "Alice decided to use Redis"
  — Missing: why Redis, what alternatives were considered, what it's used for. REWRITE to include context.

**TOO THIN (0.35)** — vague discussion with no substance:
  "The team discussed Redis"
  — Missing: what about Redis, what was decided, why it matters. Either extract the actual substance or skip.

**BAD (0.23)** — database entry style, raw IDs, no insight:
  "User U012345 stated something as of 1711234567.000100"
  — Specificity 0.3, Actionability 0.2, Verifiability 0.2 → NEVER write this.

---

### Thread context
When a `thread_context` field is present on a message, use it to make the fact
self-contained. A reply saying "yes, let's do that" to a question "should we use Redis?"
should become: "The team agreed to use Redis [for the purpose discussed in thread]."
Never leave a fact dependent on an implicit referent that isn't named.

When a thread represents a deliberation (back-and-forth discussion leading to a conclusion),
also produce a `thread_context_summary` — a single sentence capturing the deliberation arc.
Example: "Team debated Redis vs Memcached over several messages, ultimately chose Redis for its pub/sub support."
Only populate this for threads with genuine discussion; leave empty for simple Q&A threads.

### Orphaned replies
If a message appears to be a reply (has a `thread_ts` or `thread_id`) but no `thread_context`
is provided, do NOT guess or hallucinate what the parent message was about. Instead,
extract facts only from what is explicitly stated in the reply itself. If the reply
content is too vague without context (e.g., "yes, let's do that", "agreed", "+1",
"sounds good", "let's go with that"), return an empty facts array for that message.
Only extract a fact from a context-less reply if it is self-contained (e.g.,
"I deployed the hotfix to prod at 3pm").

### Media attachments
Messages may contain bracketed media descriptions appended by the preprocessing system:
- `[Attachment: filename (type, size)]` — metadata about an attached file
- `[Image description]: ...` — AI-generated description of an image attachment
- `[Document Digest]: ...` — AI-generated summary of a document (PDF, Office, etc.)
- `[Video summary]: ...` — AI-generated analysis of a video attachment
- `[Audio summary]: ...` — AI-generated transcription/summary of an audio attachment

Treat these as factual content from the message. Extract facts from media descriptions,
video summaries, audio transcriptions, and document digests just as you would from regular
message text. When a media description contains specific data points (revenue numbers,
chart values, dates, names, spoken decisions, visual content), extract those as facts.
Include the media type in entity_tags when relevant (e.g., "dashboard", "screenshot",
"report", "document", "video", "audio recording").

### Multi-fact messages
- If a message contains multiple distinct claims, extract each separately.
- If a single claim has supporting detail, extract one unified fact incorporating the detail.

---

### Tagging
- **topic_tags**: 1–3 thematic categories (e.g. "deployment", "security", "roadmap")
- **entity_tags**: named things — people, projects, services, tools
- **action_tags**: action-oriented verbs (e.g. "decided", "blocked", "shipped", "reverted")
- **importance**: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical" — based on business impact

### Fact type classification
Classify each fact as one of:
- "decision": A choice was made or agreed upon ("we decided to use Redis", "approved the budget", "agreed on the API design")
- "action_item": Something that needs to be done ("need to update the docs", "will deploy Friday", "TODO: fix the auth bug")
- "question": An unresolved question ("should we use Redis or Memcached?", "what's the timeline?", "has anyone tested this?")
- "opinion": A personal view not yet agreed upon ("I think we should use Redis", "maybe we should consider Go")
- "observation": A factual observation or status update ("the build is broken", "latency is at 200ms", "v2.1 was released yesterday")

When in doubt, default to "observation" — it is the safest classification.

### Context enrichment by fact type
Each fact should be dense — capture not just *what* but *why* and *context*. Follow these
type-specific guidelines to include the right context in the memory_text:

- **decision**: Include what was decided, WHY it was chosen, and what alternatives were
  considered or rejected if mentioned. E.g. "Alice decided to use Redis for session caching
  after evaluating Memcached, citing pub/sub support for real-time invalidation."
- **action_item**: Include what needs to be done, WHY (the motivation), WHO is responsible,
  and the deadline if mentioned. E.g. "Bob needs to update the API docs before the v2.1
  release on Friday to unblock the partner integration team."
- **question**: Include the full question, WHAT context it relates to, and WHY it matters.
  E.g. "Bob asked whether the team should migrate from REST to GraphQL, motivated by the
  mobile app's need for flexible field selection."
- **opinion**: Include the opinion, the REASONING behind it, and what it responds to.
  E.g. "Alice thinks the team should adopt TypeScript for the frontend rewrite because the
  current JavaScript codebase has too many type-related bugs in production."
- **observation**: Include the observation, its SIGNIFICANCE or impact, and what it implies.
  E.g. "API latency on /search reached 200ms, exceeding the 150ms SLA threshold and
  triggering discussion about adding a caching layer."

A fact that captures only *what* (e.g. "Alice decided to use Redis") is TOO THIN.
A fact that captures *what + why + context* in 1-2 sentences is the target quality.

### Per-message metadata
For each fact, copy from the source message:
- `source_message_id`: the message `msg_id` field (e.g. "msg-0", "msg-1", "msg-2"). This is REQUIRED.
- `author_id`: the `user` field
- `author_name`: the display name (use display name in memory_text, NOT the raw user ID)
- `message_ts`: the `ts` field (copy the exact value from the message)

---

## Phase 3 — enrichment fields (OPTIONAL — populate when applicable)

For each extracted fact, if it makes sense given the source message,
also populate these structured fields. Skip them entirely (do NOT
emit empty strings or fabrications) when the source doesn't support
the field.

### When `fact_type == "decision"`:

- `rationale`: the SINGLE-sentence justification — what the
  decision is FOR. Look for "because", "since", "to ensure",
  "in order to" clauses. Examples:
    Source: "Adopt CLA — provides relicensing flexibility for
            commercial forks."
    rationale: "Provides relicensing flexibility for commercial forks."

- `alternatives_considered`: a list of options that were
  considered and rejected. Look for "vs", "rather than", "rejected",
  "instead of", "considered". Each item is 1-3 words naming the
  alternative. Examples:
    Source: "Adopt Copyright-assignment CLA. DCO and License-grant
            CLA were considered but rejected."
    alternatives_considered: ["DCO", "License-grant CLA"]

- `consequences_open`: open questions raised in the SAME thread
  about downstream effects. Each item is a 1-sentence question.
  Examples:
    Source: "Adopt CLA. But will contributors hesitate to sign?
            Need a CLA bot before public PRs."
    consequences_open: [
      "Will contributors hesitate to sign?",
      "Need CLA bot before public PRs"
    ]

### When `fact_type in {{"opinion", "recommendation"}}`:

- `sentiment`: one of:
    "neutral" — descriptive, no value judgment.
    "concerning" — raises a concern or warning.
    "positive" — endorsement or favorable view.
    "recommendation" — explicit suggestion to do something.
  Default to `null` if uncertain — do NOT guess.

### For ANY `fact_type`:

- `numeric_values`: list of significant numbers (≥ 100 OR currency
  values OR percentages with explicit context). Each item:
    {{
      "label": "noun describing what's being counted (e.g. 'stars',
                'impressions', 'paid-media equivalent')",
      "value": "display form (e.g. '2,396', '534k', 'HK$130k')",
      "raw_value": 2396,
      "unit": "USD" | "HKD" | "stars" | etc. — null when no unit
    }}
  Skip throwaway numbers (years, version numbers like "v0.2",
  page numbers). Cap at 5 items per fact.

- `glossary_terms`: list of acronyms (3+ uppercase letters)
  or domain-specific terms used in this fact's text. The wiki
  layer filters this against the channel glossary; you don't
  need to know which terms ARE in the glossary — just list
  candidates. Examples: ["CLA", "DCO", "MFA", "RAG", "SAML"]

---

### Output format
Return a single JSON object:
```json
{{
  "facts": [
    {{
      "memory_text": "<self-contained fact — human-readable, no raw IDs>",
      "quality_score": <float 0.0–1.0>,
      "topic_tags": ["<tag>", ...],
      "entity_tags": ["<entity>", ...],
      "action_tags": ["<action>", ...],
      "importance": "<low|medium|high|critical>",
      "fact_type": "<decision|opinion|observation|action_item|question>",
      "thread_context_summary": "<1-sentence deliberation arc, or empty string>",
      "source_message_id": "<msg_id, e.g. msg-0>",
      "author_id": "<user id>",
      "author_name": "<display name>",
      "message_ts": "<timestamp>",
      "rationale": "<optional — decisions only>",
      "alternatives_considered": ["<optional — decisions only>"],
      "consequences_open": ["<optional — decisions only>"],
      "numeric_values": [
        {{"label": "<noun>", "value": "<display>", "raw_value": <number>, "unit": "<unit or null>"}}
      ],
      "sentiment": "<optional — opinions/recommendations only>",
      "glossary_terms": ["<optional — acronyms/domain terms>"]
    }}
  ],
  "skip_reason": null
}}
```

The Phase 3 enrichment fields (`rationale`, `alternatives_considered`,
`consequences_open`, `numeric_values`, `sentiment`, `glossary_terms`)
are ALL OPTIONAL — omit them entirely when they don't apply. Never emit
empty placeholder strings or fabricated values just to populate the field.

If the entire batch contains no extractable facts (only greetings, noise, or off-topic content),
return `{{"facts": [], "skip_reason": "<brief reason>"}}`.

Do not invent information. Extract only what is explicitly stated or directly implied.
