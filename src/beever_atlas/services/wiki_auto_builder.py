"""Auto-trigger the initial wiki build on first sync.

Wired into ``server/app.py:_resolve_and_run`` so the very first time the
ExtractionWorker reports facts for a channel that has no wiki yet, we
fire the canonical ``WikiBuilder.refresh_wiki`` once. Subsequent
extraction events fall through to the incremental
``WikiMaintainer.on_extraction_done`` path.

Why this lives outside the maintainer
-------------------------------------
``WikiMaintainer.on_extraction_done`` is incremental — it routes facts to
existing pages via ``plan_updates`` and rewrites them. It cannot produce
the initial channel structure (folder tree, Overview, page plan); that
is the structure-planner's job inside ``WikiBuilder.refresh_wiki``. So a
channel with zero pages stays empty until the planner runs once. This
module is the single place that decides "first build" should fire and
calls the canonical builder path used by ``POST /wiki/refresh``.

Decisions encoded
-----------------
* **Threshold gate**: skip when fact count is below
  ``WIKI_AUTO_INITIAL_BUILD_THRESHOLD`` (default 10) — a single-fact
  wiki is worse than no wiki.
* **Idempotency via cache.get_generation_status**: ``running`` /
  ``completed`` / ``failed`` all short-circuit. No retries on failure —
  user retries via the Generate button so a persistent prompt/quota
  error cannot loop.
* **Race-safe slot reservation**: ``set_generation_status("running")``
  before the builder fires. Concurrent ``on_extraction_done`` events
  for the same channel re-enter this function and see ``running``, so
  at most one build fires.
* **Caller short-circuits maintainer**: when this returns ``True``, the
  caller MUST skip ``maintainer.on_extraction_done`` for the same
  fact_ids — otherwise an incremental rewrite races the from-scratch
  build for the same pages.
