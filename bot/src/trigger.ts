/**
 * Trigger gate for subscribed-thread messages.
 *
 * Once the bot is @mentioned in a thread it calls `thread.subscribe()`, after
 * which the SDK routes EVERY message in that thread to `onSubscribedMessage` —
 * including the bot's own replies and messages that don't mention it. Without a
 * gate the bot answers everything, which is the "why does it reply so many
 * times" bug. This pure decision function encodes the intended behavior so it
 * can be unit-tested without a live SDK.
 *
 * Rules (in order):
 *   1. Never answer the bot's own messages (`isMe`).
 *   2. Never answer other bots (`isBot === true`). `"unknown"` is treated as a
 *      human (we don't suppress on uncertainty).
 *   3. An explicit @mention always gets an answer, even in a busy channel.
 *   4. Otherwise, if the thread has become a multi-human conversation
 *      (`humanCount >= quietThreshold`), withdraw (`unsubscribe`) and stay quiet
 *      so humans can talk without the bot interjecting.
 *   5. Otherwise the thread is still effectively 1:1 with the bot — answer.
