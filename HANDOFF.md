## ⚡ Quick state

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| **PR-0 → PR-G backend** | ✅ Shipped, tests green |
| **Frontend (Tensions / Lint / Maintain / Enriching row)** | ✅ Shipped, 65/65 tests pass, tsc clean |
| **`POST /wiki/maintain` endpoint** | ✅ Shipped (3 tests green) |
| **Env var consolidation 12 → 6** | ✅ Shipped, three Opus reviews APPROVED |
| **`.env.example` simplified** | ✅ One-line per flag |
| **Local `.env` updated** | ✅ User's `.env` has the 6 new flags |
| **PR-x reference scrub** | ✅ Shipped — committed in 2bbf857 + 0d7e51e |
| **WikiMaintainer lifespan wiring** | ✅ Shipped — committed in 2bfe470 (init + ExtractionWorker subscription) |
| **MCP tools** | ❌ Not started — see below |
| **Migration script (legacy → wiki_pages)** | ❌ Not started |
| **Integration docs** | ❌ Not started |

## ✅ Recently shipped (this session)

- **PR-x scrub completed** — 11 staged files committed in `0d7e51e`; second batch (~30 references) followed the same translation rules as the prior `2bbf857`. 90/90 targeted tests green, ruff format clean.
- **WikiMaintainer lifespan wiring** — committed in `2bfe470`. `WikiPageStore` + `WikiMaintainer` are initialised in `src/beever_atlas/server/app.py` after `SyncScheduler.startup()`, then `worker.subscribe_extraction_done(...)` registers a `create_task` callback that fans extraction batches to `maintainer.on_extraction_done(channel_id, fact_ids, mode=settings.wiki_maintenance_mode)`. 130/130 targeted tests green.
- `POST /api/channels/{id}/wiki/maintain` no longer returns `reason=maintainer_not_initialized`; `WIKI_MAINTENANCE_MODE=auto` now actually fires per-batch.

## 📋 Remaining work (prioritized)

### 🟡 P1 — Nice to have before staging soak

1. **MCP tool wrappers** (~1 hour)
   - The endpoints exist. The MCP server in `src/beever_atlas/api/mcp_server/` needs three new tool functions:
     - `search_memory(query, scope?)` — cross-channel agent recall via Weaviate hybrid search
     - `lint_wiki(channel_id)` — proxies POST `/wiki/lint`
     - `get_extraction_status(channel_id)` — proxies GET `/extraction-status`
   - Look at existing tools in `_tools_retrieval.py` for the pattern.

2. **Wiki migration script** (~1 hour)
   - Spec task 6.16. One-shot migration from legacy `wiki_cache.pages.{page_id}` subdocs to per-page `wiki_pages` rows.
   - Pattern: copy `src/beever_atlas/scripts/migrate_imported_messages_to_channel_messages.py` and adapt.
   - Idempotent via the compound unique index; supports `--dry-run`.

### 🟢 P2 — Polish / longer-horizon

3. **Integration docs** — `docs/integrations/openclaw.md`, `hermes.md`, `push-sources.md`
   - Spec tasks 5.21-5.23. Cookbook for "register a source + sign a request + handle replays".

4. **Per-channel `wiki_maintenance_mode`** — analyst's recommendation
   - Today it's a global env var. Spec D10 says it should be per-channel.
   - Migration: add `wiki_maintenance_mode` field to the channel document, fall back to env var, expose UI toggle.

5. **Page-voice drift A/B comparator** — spec task 7.19
   - The maintainer has the seam; need the actual comparator that runs both `apply_update` and `WikiBuilder.generate_wiki` in parallel during soak and reports edit-distance.
   - Two-week comparison gates the `WIKI_MAINTENANCE_MODE=auto` default flip.

6. **Re-run the full code review** after the lifespan-wiring commit lands on `main`. Three Opus passes already approved the prior state; this is a smoke check that the scrub + lifespan wiring didn't introduce subtle issues.

## 🎯 Design evaluation — is this redesign actually better?

**Yes, on all four stated outcomes.** Honest assessment:

| Outcome | Before redesign | After |
|---|---|---|
| **Faster pipeline** | Sync blocks on LLM extraction; 100-msg sync = ~5 min | Sync persists messages and returns in ~3 sec; extraction proceeds in background. **~100x faster perceived sync.** |
| **Errors don't kill the pipeline** | Single Gemini 503 → cursor doesn't advance, all batches discarded | Cursor advances on fetch success regardless; failed rows auto-retry with exponential backoff; CircuitBreaker centralizes the fast-fail. **Validated by simulated 503 storm test.** |
| **LLM Wiki bookkeeping** | Full regenerate every refresh; 7+N_clusters LLM calls per refresh | Maintainer routes new facts to affected pages deterministically; rewrites only changed sections; preserves title/slug/voice. **Bounded cost, compounds instead of regenerates.** |
| **Push-ready (OpenClaw / Hermes)** | No push endpoint | `POST /api/sources/{id}/events` with HMAC + 24h idempotency + 10MB streaming body cap. **OpenClaw can integrate today.** |

### Weaknesses honestly:

1. **`WIKI_MAINTENANCE_MODE` is still global, not per-channel.** Operators can't tell channel A "auto" and channel B "manual" without code change. Acknowledged limitation; tracked as P2.4 above.

2. **Failover seam is dead code in OSS.** `_FAILOVER_ENABLED=False` ships disabled because OSS doesn't have a second-provider key (Gemini Flash Lite as fallback for Gemini Pro is same-provider — when the primary's down so is the fallback). Real cross-provider failover needs enterprise tier.

3. **No worker observability.** No metrics endpoint exposing queue depth / claim rate / failure rate. Operator has to grep logs. Worth adding before scale matters.

4. **Pre-existing test pollution** in `tests/test_sync_runner.py` (4 tests fail under certain pytest orderings). Not caused by the redesign; same on `main`. PR-C structurally removed the cause (module globals) but a stale fixture interaction remains.

5. **Frontend is unblocked but raw.** The Tensions / Lint / Maintain / Enriching UI ships, but no component tests for the new pieces (only the dedupeErrors util has unit tests). A polish pass for visual regressions is worth doing on a real channel.

6. **No staging soak metrics dashboard.** The runbook says "watch this Mongo aggregation" but there's no Grafana / metrics endpoint to see them in real time. Operators will use the API endpoint + Mongo shell.

### Things we considered and explicitly DIDN'T do (for good reasons):

- **Multi-tenancy / ACL / SSO / non-chat extractors** — explicitly OUT OF SCOPE per the OSS positioning. Deferred until customer pull.
- **Real durable queue (Redis / BullMQ)** — Mongo queue is sufficient at OSS scale. Architecture supports swapping.
- **Obsidian export / external markdown** — explicitly rejected by user; wiki UI lives in-app.
- **`KnowledgeAtom` rename of `channel_messages`** — Opus consensus rejected as cosmetic churn.
- **Prometheus / Grafana metrics emission** — structured logs + status endpoint cover OSS visibility.

## ✅ What's been verified

- **207/207 backend PR-A→G tests pass** (last full run before context tight)
- **65/65 web tests pass** (last run after frontend additions)
- **`tsc --noEmit` clean** (last check)
- **`ruff check src/ tests/` clean** (last check, before scrub agent's edits — the scrub edits should also pass since it's just comment changes)
- **`ruff format --check src/ tests/` clean** (last check)
- **Three sequential Opus 4.7 code reviews APPROVED** — zero CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM open issues
- **Architect + Analyst Opus reviews on env var cleanup** — converged on the 6-flag surface that shipped
